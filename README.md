# Meetup x Pokemon
Meetup x Pokemon is a partial clone of "Meetup", a social platform for connecting people with similar interests. It is themed for people in the Kanto region of the Pokemon series. This is my first full stack application and was completed in two weeks. Future functionality includes AWS S3 implementation and polishing for a better user experience.
